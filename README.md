# Movie Time

# To build:
1. Clone repo: `git clone https://github.com/mordra/mvtm`
2. `npm i`
3. `npm run start`

# Notes:
I used [a react generator](https://github.com/newtriks/generator-react-webpack) to provide the boilerplate template.

Did not use Redux (for store) or any styling libraries because the problem was fairly trivial and a store would have been overkill.

Here is my [hobby project](https://github.com/mordra/cotwmtor) that demonstrates [redux store](https://github.com/mordra/cotwmtor/blob/master/client/entry.jsx), [reducers](https://github.com/mordra/cotwmtor/tree/master/client/reducers), [action creators](https://github.com/mordra/cotwmtor/blob/master/client/actions/index.js), [stateless](https://github.com/mordra/cotwmtor/blob/master/client/charCreation/attributes.jsx) [components](https://github.com/mordra/cotwmtor/blob/master/client/charCreation/gender.jsx) and [jasmine/karma tests](https://github.com/mordra/cotwmtor/tree/master/tests)

Most of the code is in the [main.js](https://github.com/mordra/mvtm/blob/master/src/components/Main.js) component.
