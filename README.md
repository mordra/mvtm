# Movie Time

# To build:
1. Clone repo: git clone https://github.com/mordra/mvtm
2. `npm i`
3. `npm run start`

# Notes:
I used [a react generator](https://github.com/newtriks/generator-react-webpack) to provide the boilerplate template.

Did not use Redux (for store) or any styling libraries because the problem was fairly trivial and a store would have been overkill.
If you want to see a proper setup with redux, jasmine/karma, please have a look at my side project [Castle of the Winds](https://github.com/mordra/cotwmtor).
